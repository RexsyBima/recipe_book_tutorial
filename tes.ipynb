You may need to repeat this process 2 or 3 times before the dough stays this size, with brief rests between rolling attempts. To achieve thin edges, rotate the dough with your non-dominant hand gradually as you roll out the edges of the oval using a pin in your dominant hand.\",\n",

Place the steamer trays and lid on top of the pot (or pan) and steam for 10 minutes. Remove the steamer basket from the water and let the buns rest inside, still covered, for 10 additional minutes.

Add 1 teaspoon of oil to a small (6\\\" or 8\\\" diameter) nonstick pan and heat over medium to medium-low until the oil shimmers. Pour in enough of the egg mixture to coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Lower the heat to prevent any sizzling, if necessary. Cook the egg mixture undisturbed until the bottom is set, 1 to 2 minutes depending on the pan size. While the top is still slightly wet, fold the omelet over onto itself 2 or more times to create a roughly 2\\\"-wide strip across the diameter of the pan. (If cooking in a 6\\\" nonstick pan, these omelets easily fold into thirds. If using a larger pan, you may need to make more folds.)\",\n",
